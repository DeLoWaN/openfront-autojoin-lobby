## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update AutoJoinUI markup to wrap the Modes section in a dedicated container/affordance.
- [x] 1.2 Replace full-panel collapse behavior with modes-compact hover logic (auto-expand on hover, auto-collapse on leave).
- [x] 1.3 Update styles to show a compact Modes rail/affordance and preserve status/actions visibility.
- [x] 1.4 Add/adjust tests for hover expansion and visibility rules (if applicable).
- [x] 1.5 Manually verify compact/hover behavior in lobby.
